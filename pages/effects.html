      >Effects are often added to the final sound in subtractive synthesis to
      add tone, texture, and character.
    </span>
    Commonly used effects are reverb, chorus, distortion, and delay. Each have a
    very specific application and use case and, much like the usage of LFO's and
    envelopes, can transform a synthetic sound into something more organic and
    lifelike.

  <p>
    These can be used in a variety of different ways to either make a sound
    smooth and dreamy, or harsh and aggressive. The sky is the limit!
