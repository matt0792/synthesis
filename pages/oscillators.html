      >An oscillator is a repeating waveform, it can be thought of as a graph of
      the speakers' movement over time.</span

    When a point on the graph is all the way at the top, the speaker is fully
    extended, and vice versa for a point on the bottom.

    Different shapes of oscillators create different distributions of harmonics,
    which will ultimately play a large part in the overall character of your
    sound.
  </p>
  <p>
    One can stack many oscillators on top of each other, creating a rich,
    complex waveform to be shaped and refined down the line.
