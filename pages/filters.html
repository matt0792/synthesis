      >A filter is a tool that can be used to remove or boost certain
      frequencies in an audio signal, while allowing others to pass
      through.</span

    In a subtractive synth, we can use these filters to shape our complex
    waveform into something more refined and musical.

    Much like oscillators, there are many types of filters that each affect the
    sound in their own unique way. Commonly used types are high-pass (removes
    low frequencies), low pass (removes high frequencies), and band-pass
    (removes frequencies outside a specified range).

    Filters can be controlled by external modulators like envelopes and lfo's,
    to create movement and add character to the sound.

    A low pass filter. Notice controls for the cutoff frequency and resonance
    (Q), as well as how it has smoothed out the sharp corners of the triangle
    wave.
